# HR System

## Basic Information

This program is an HR System made using Python and the Pygame library for the GUI. I wanted to learn how to code using Pygame and create my own textboxes and pages to understand how they are made. 

It is also built with a Microsoft SQL database as I was learning it, so the program is basic with just simple storing, retrieving, and table creation commands.

This program uses many objects and classes that seem to serve no real purpose, and that's because I wanted to understand how complex and embedded you could create objects. A simple fix to make it more proper is to put all variables in the employee class and avoid subclasses for it.

The `Textbox` class is important and serves as an actual class that should exist in this program, along with the employee code.

## Description

The point of this project was to learn, which is why some parts might seem strange. Please refer to the Basic Information section for more details. However, it was also meant to be something professional, which is why it uses databases instead of text files and has a GUI rather than just typing in a terminal.

This program is simple in functionality. It collects data for employees, such as first name, address, phone number, and much more, then stores it in a SQL database. You can add, edit, or delete employee records by searching for them using their employee number.

The employee number is the primary key, which cannot be changed by the user. It is automatically generated by the system to ensure that no duplicates exist and that everyone has a unique employee number.

### Add Function

The Add function will bring you to a new page with several textboxes. You simply click on each textbox, type the information you want (following the header), and hit submit to add the data to the database. If you wish to cancel, you can return to the main page.

### Edit Function

The Edit function works similarly to the Add function. However, it automatically displays the existing information for the selected employee, based on the employee number. You can then modify and save the data.

### Delete Function

The Delete function takes the employee number provided, deletes the employee record from the list and the database, and then reorders the remaining employee numbers so there are no gaps (i.e., it goes from 1 to the total number of employees). This can be adjusted if needed, or you could save the deleted records to a separate table to avoid losing any data.

## How to Use

1. Download the folder and open `main.py`.
2. Run the script, and it will bring you to the main page with three buttons and a search bar.
3. To add an employee, click the "Add" button.
4. To delete or edit an employee, enter a valid employee number and click "Edit" or "Delete".
5. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
